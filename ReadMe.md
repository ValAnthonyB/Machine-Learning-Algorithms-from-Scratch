Using the theory developed in the Coursera course "Machine Learning by Andrew Ng" we implement supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms from scratch using only NumPy in Python.

## 1 Regression
* Univariate linear regression
* Multiple linear regression
* Polynomial regression

## 2 Classification
* Logistic Regression
* k-Nearest Neighbors
* Support Vector Machines
* Artificial Neural Network

## 3 Clustering
* k-Means
* Mean Shift
