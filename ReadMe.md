# Numerical Analysis From Scratch Using Python

Using the theory developed in the Coursera course "Machine Learning by Andrew Ng" we implement supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms from scratch using only NumPy in Python.

## 1 Regression
* Univariate linear regression
* Multiple linear regression
* Polynomial regression

## 2 Classification
* TBA

## 3 Clustering
* TBA
