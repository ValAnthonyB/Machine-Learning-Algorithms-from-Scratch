Using the theory developed in the Coursera course "Machine Learning by Andrew Ng" we implement supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms from scratch using only NumPy in Python.

## 1 Regression
* Univariate linear regression
* Multiple linear regression
* Polynomial regression

## 2 Classification
* Logistic Regression
* k-Nearest Neighbors
* Gaussian Discriminant Analysis
* NÃ¤ive Bayes
* Support Vector Machines
* Artificial Neural Network
* Decision Trees

## 3 Clustering
* k-Means
* k-Medians
* Mean Shift
* Gaussian Mixture Model
* DBSCAN

## 4 Gradient Descent Variations
* Stochastic Gradient Descent
* Mini-batch Gradient Descent
* Gradient Descent with Momentum
* BFGS

## 5 Dimensionality Reduction
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
